# modelFactory 

A light-weight model layer that bridges the gap between AngularJS and your RESTful APIs.

Why would you use this over other available solutions?

- Lightweight/Simple, the code simply does some basic copy/extending and prototypical instances; no magic required.
- Patterns/Practices, the model definition closely resembles Angular's ngResource meaning its easy to swap out, replace later, eases scaling/transition, and its designed for Angular; not a backbone port!
- Utilizes Angular at the core, it doesn't duplicate things Angular already does.  Any action can be passed a `$http` configuration option, all your interceptors still work, it uses Angular's cache, etc!
- Compliant, URI Template matches the specs.
- Small - 1.45KB gzipped/minified ( excludes depedencies )
- Minimal Dependencies, only use URI template and deep-diff ( this isn't even required ) utility.  NO underscore, lodash, jquery, etc!
- Its full of awesome features
